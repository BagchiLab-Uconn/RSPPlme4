Many analyses that use spatial point patterns seek answers to questions
about what factors generate variation among cases.

This package implements the method described by Bagchi and Illian (2015)
for replicated point pattern analysis, using algorithms for mixed
effects models from the `lme4` package Bates et al. (2015).
