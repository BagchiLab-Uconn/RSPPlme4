Title: Analysis of Relicated Point Patterns with lme4
Version: 0.0.1

Description: Many analyses that use spatial point patterns seek answers 
    to questions about what factors generate variation among cases. 
    This package implements the method used by Bagchi and Illian (2014)
    for replicated point pattern analysis, using algorithms for mixed 
    effects models from the lme4 package.
