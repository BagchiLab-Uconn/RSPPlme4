# Description

Many analyses that use spatial point patterns seek answers to questions
about what factors generate variation among cases. 

# Bibliography

This package implements the method described by 
@Bagchi.Illian_2015_MethodsinEcologyandEvolution for 
replicated point pattern analysis, 
using algorithms for mixed effects models from the `lme4` package 
@Bates.etal_2015_JournalofStatisticalSoftware.
