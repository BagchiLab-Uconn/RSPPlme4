# Description

Many analyses that use spatial point patterns seek answers to questions
about what factors generate variation among cases. 

This package implements the method described by 
@Bagchi.Illian_2015_MethodsinEcologyandEvolution for 
replicated point pattern analysis, 
using algorithms for mixed effects models from the `lme4` package 
@Bates.etal_2015_JournalofStatisticalSoftware.

To get an idea for how to use the package for basic analyses, refer to the tutorial we wrote @Bagchi.etal_2022_Front.For.Glob.Change.
